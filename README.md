# Embedded Systems Final Project
A team project to build an Arduino based robot car that follow the closest object in front of it. The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect how close objects are in front of it. THe ultrasonic sensor is controlled by a pulse generate by the on-board Arduino timer. Also, there is an IR remote to manually turn the robot (right or left) by communicating with the IR sensor on the robot. An interrupt is used so that manual control takes presedent over the robot automatic behavior. The chassis of the robot was designed in CAD and 3D printed. <br>
